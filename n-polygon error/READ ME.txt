this python code aims to calculate the maximum error in the area of an n-sided polygon compared to that of a circle 
it prompts the user to provide an error rate (between 0 and 1), calculates the area of the polygon and the circle, and then determines the maximum number of sides for the polygon to achieve an error rate below the specified threshold.
the code utilizes the decimal module for precise arithmetic calculations and prints out the error values for each iteration to track the progress of the calculation
